# PlantUML 시퀀스 다이어그램 가이드

# 기본 예제

시퀀스 `->`는 두명의 참가자 사이의 메시지를 그리는데 사용됩니다. 참가자들은 명시적으로 선언 할 필요가 없습니다. 점선을 표현하기 위해서는 `-->`를 사용합니다.

`<-`와 `<--`도 사용가능합니다. 참가자의 위치는 변화하지 않지만 코드의 가독성을 향상시킵니다. 이것은 시퀀스 다이어그램에만 적용되며 다른 다이어그램은 다른 규칙을 가집니다.

Comments

Everything that starts with simple quote ' is a comment.

You can also put comments on several lines using /' to start and '/ to end.

Declaring participant

It is possible to change participant order using the participant keyword.
It is also possible to use other keywords to declare a participant:

actor
boundary
control
entity
database
@startuml
actor Foo1
boundary Foo2
control Foo3
entity Foo4
database Foo5
Foo1 -> Foo2 : To boundary
Foo1 -> Foo3 : To control
Foo1 -> Foo4 : To entity
Foo1 -> Foo5 : To database

@enduml
using different actors in UML sequence diagram
You can rename a participant using the as keyword.

You can also change the background color of actor or participant.

@startuml
actor Bob #red
' The only difference between actor
'and participant is the drawing
participant Alice
participant "I have a really\nlong name" as L #99FF99
/' You can also declare:
   participant L as "I have a really\nlong name"  #99FF99
  '/

Alice->Bob: Authentication Request
Bob->Alice: Authentication Response
Bob->L: Log transaction
@enduml
Long name of actors in UML sequence diagram
Use non-letters in participants

You can use quotes to define participants. And you can use the as keyword to give an alias to those participants.
@startuml
Alice -> "Bob()" : Hello
"Bob()" -> "This is very\nlong" as Long
' You can also declare:
' "Bob()" -> Long as "This is very\nlong"
Long --> "Bob()" : ok
@enduml
actor can use non-lette character
Message to Self

A participant can send a message to itself.
It is also possible to have multi-line using \n.

@startuml
Alice->Alice: This is a signal to self.\nIt also demonstrates\nmultiline \ntext
@enduml

Change arrow style

You can change arrow style by several ways:
add a final x to denote a lost message
use \ or / instead of < or > to have only the bottom or top part of the arrow
repeat the arrow head (for example, >> or //) head to have a thin drawing
use -- instead of - to have a dotted arrow
add a final "o" at arrow head
use bidirectional arrow
@startuml
Bob ->x Alice
Bob -> Alice
Bob ->> Alice
Bob -\ Alice
Bob \\- Alice
Bob //-- Alice

Bob ->o Alice
Bob o\\-- Alice

Bob <-> Alice
Bob <->o Alice

Change arrow color

You can change the color of individual arrows using the following notation:
@startuml
Bob -[#red]> Alice : hello
Alice -[#0000FF]->Bob : ok
@enduml

Message sequence numbering

The keyword autonumber is used to automatically add number to messages.
@startuml
autonumber
Bob -> Alice : Authentication Request
Bob <- Alice : Authentication Response
@enduml
automatic message numbering in UML sequence diagram
You can specify a startnumber with autonumber 'start' , and also an increment with autonumber 'start' 'increment'.
@startuml
autonumber
Bob -> Alice : Authentication Request
Bob <- Alice : Authentication Response

autonumber 15
Bob -> Alice : Another authentication Request
Bob <- Alice : Another authentication Response

autonumber 40 10
Bob -> Alice : Yet another authentication Request
Bob <- Alice : Yet another authentication Response

@enduml
change start and increment of automatic numbering in #UML sequence diagram
You can specify a format for your number by using between double-quote.
The formatting is done with the Java class DecimalFormat ('0' means digit, '#' means digit and zero if absent).

You can use some html tag in the format.

@startuml
autonumber "<b>[000]"
Bob -> Alice : Authentication Request
Bob <- Alice : Authentication Response

autonumber 15 "<b>(<u>##</u>)"
Bob -> Alice : Another authentication Request
Bob <- Alice : Another authentication Response

autonumber 40 10 "<font color=red><b>Message 0  "
Bob -> Alice : Yet another authentication Request
Bob <- Alice : Yet another authentication Response

@enduml
using custom format for automatic numbering
You can also use autonumber stop and autonumber resume 'increment' 'format' to respectively pause and resume automatic numbering.
@startuml
autonumber 10 10 "<b>[000]"
Bob -> Alice : Authentication Request
Bob <- Alice : Authentication Response

autonumber stop
Bob -> Alice : dummy

autonumber resume "<font color=red><b>Message 0  "
Bob -> Alice : Yet another authentication Request
Bob <- Alice : Yet another authentication Response

autonumber stop
Bob -> Alice : dummy

autonumber resume 1 "<font color=blue><b>Message 0  "

Splitting diagrams

The newpage keyword is used to split a diagram into several images.
You can put a title for the new page just after the newpage keyword.

This is very handy with Word to print long diagram on several pages.

@startuml

Alice -> Bob : message 1
Alice -> Bob : message 2

newpage

Alice -> Bob : message 3
Alice -> Bob : message 4

newpage A title for the\nlast page

Grouping message

It is possible to group messages together using the following keywords:

alt/else
opt
loop
par
break
critical
group, followed by a text to be displayed
It is possible a add a text that will be displayed into the header (except for group).

The end keyword is used to close the group.

Note that it is possible to nest groups.

@startuml
Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request

alt successful case

    Bob -> Alice: Authentication Accepted
    
else some kind of failure

    Bob -> Alice: Authentication Failure
    group My own label
    	Alice -> Log : Log attack start
        loop 1000 times
            Alice -> Bob: DNS Attack

Notes on messages

It is possible to put notes on message using the note left or note right keywords just after the message.
You can have a multi-line note using the end note keywords.

@startuml
Alice->Bob : hello
note left: this is a first note

Bob->Alice : ok
note right: this is another note

Bob->Bob : I am thinking
note left
	a note
	can also be defined

Lifeline Activation and Destruction

The activate and deactivate are used to denote participant activation.
Once a participant is activated, its lifeline appears.

The activate and deactivate apply on the previous message.

The destroy denote the end of the lifeline of a participant.

@startuml

Stereotypes and Spots

It is possible to add stereotypes to participants using << and >>.
In the stereotype, you can add a spotted character in a colored circle using the syntax (X,color).

@startuml

participant "Famous Bob" as Bob << Generated >>
participant Alice << (C,#ADD1B2) Testable >>

Bob->Alice: First message

@enduml

By default, the guillemet character is used to display the stereotype. You can change this behavious using the skinparam guillemet:
@startuml

skinparam guillemet false
participant "Famous Bob" as Bob << Generated >>
participant Alice << (C,#ADD1B2) Testable >>

Bob->Alice: First message
